# Image Data Processing

This repository includes solutions to the exercises in my 
Image Data Processing class. Code is written in Jupyter Notebook.

## Libraries used

(using **Python:** 3.9.11)

- Tensorflow 2.5.0
- Matplotlib 3.5.0
- Numpy 1.21.4
- cv2 4.5.5

## Number Recognition

In this exercise  I am training a convolutional neural network on
the MNIST dataset. You can find it in the `Number_recognition` 
directory. Directory contains two scripts: `training.ipynb` 
and `testing.ipynb`. The first one is self-explanatory I think. 
In the `testing.ipynb` script I am testing trained model on data 
in `7v0` directory.
